However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks. We release the code, constructed instruction data, and model checkpoints in https://github.com/chenlong164/PEIT.","tags":[],"title":"Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning for Multi-task Molecule Generation with Large Language Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["刘晴瑞"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1734393600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1734393600,"objectID":"0d05061a524b1f4b5e1df3ba744fe20d","permalink":"http://localhost:39623/tutorials/24-12-17-person-tutorials/","publishdate":"2024-12-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tutorials/24-12-17-person-tutorials/","section":"tutorials","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"如何写自己的个人信息页面","type":"tutorials"},{"authors":["BioAI"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1727528400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1727528400,"objectID":"ac765f5db6896e2c28cf6745894ff850","permalink":"http://localhost:39623/event/2024.01/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/2024.01/","section":"event","summary":"Xiangtan Huayin Ecological Garden Tuanjian Team Building","tags":[],"title":"湘潭华银生态园团建","type":"event"},{"authors":["Guosheng Han","Lingzhi Peng","Aocheng Ding","Yan Zhang","Xuan Lin"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Existing similarity-based methods often overlook simple yet valuable structural information or ignore multiple relationships from biological entities (e.g., target proteins and enzymes). Meanwhile, matrix factorization-based methods can alleviate the inherent sparsity issues in DDI data. However, this line of work usually only considers the original association information of DDI pairs. To address these issues, we proposed a novel tensor factorization strategy with effective constraint terms (CTF-DDI) for potential DDI prediction. Specifically, we first obtained drug features by constructing specific similarity matrices based on drug structure and drug-related biological associations. Then, a novel constrained tensor factorization(CTF) module was designed to further reconstruct drug similarity by introducing Hessian and regularization as constraints. Finally, we trained a deep neural network to extract nonlinear features for DDI prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed CTF-DDI model outperforms classical tensor factorization and deep learning models. Furthermore, ablation and case studies validated the performance of CTF-DDI in DDI prediction. The source code of CTF-DDI is available at https://github.com/angelfacedac/CTF_DDI.","tags":[],"title":"CTF-DDI: Constrained tensor factorization for drug--drug interactions prediction","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:39623/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:39623/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"http://localhost:39623/tour/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Congratulations to Jian Yang and Monica Hall for winning the Best Paper Award at the 2020 Conference on Wowchemy for their paper “Learning Wowchemy”.\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
