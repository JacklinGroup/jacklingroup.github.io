However, due to the lack of labeled data and the difficulty of manual annotation for biochemical properties, the performance for molecule generation tasks is still limited, especially for tasks involving multi-properties constraints. In this work, we present a two-step framework PEIT (Property Enhanced Instruction Tuning) to improve LLMs for molecular-related tasks. In the first step, we use textual descriptions, SMILES, and biochemical properties as multimodal inputs to pre-train a model called PEIT-GEN, by aligning multi-modal representations to synthesize instruction data. In the second step, we fine-tune existing open-source LLMs with the synthesized data, the resulting PEIT-LLM can handle molecule captioning, text-based molecule generation, molecular property prediction, and our newly proposed multi-constraint molecule generation tasks. Experimental results show that our pre-trained PEIT-GEN outperforms MolT5 and BioT5 in molecule captioning, demonstrating modalities align well between textual descriptions, structures, and biochemical properties. Furthermore, PEIT-LLM shows promising improvements in multi-task molecule generation, proving the scalability of the PEIT framework for various molecular tasks.

Existing similarity-based methods often overlook simple yet valuable structural information or ignore multiple relationships from biological entities (e.g., target proteins and enzymes). Meanwhile, matrix factorization-based methods can alleviate the inherent sparsity issues in DDI data. However, this line of work usually only considers the original association information of DDI pairs. To address these issues, we proposed a novel tensor factorization strategy with effective constraint terms (CTF-DDI) for potential DDI prediction. Specifically, we first obtained drug features by constructing specific similarity matrices based on drug structure and drug-related biological associations. Then, a novel constrained tensor factorization(CTF) module was designed to further reconstruct drug similarity by introducing Hessian and regularization as constraints. Finally, we trained a deep neural network to extract nonlinear features for DDI prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed CTF-DDI model outperforms classical tensor factorization and deep learning models. Furthermore, ablation and case studies validated the performance of CTF-DDI in DDI prediction.

Predicting potential DDI is also essential for clinical research. Given the high cost and risk of wet-lab experiments, in-silico DDI prediction is an alternative choice. Recently, deep learning methods have been developed for DDI prediction. However, most of existing methods focus on feature extraction from either molecular SMILES sequences or drug interactive networks, ignoring the valuable complementary information that can be derived from these two views. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable Multi-View Attention network (MVA-DDI) for DDI prediction. MVA-DDI can effectively extracts drug representations from different perspectives to improve DDI prediction. Specifically, for a given drug, we design a transformer-based encoder and a graph convolutional networkbased encoder to learn sequence and graph representations from SMILES sequence and molecular graph, respectively. To fully exploit the complementary information between the sequence and molecular views, an attention mechanism is further adopted to adaptively aggregate the sequence and graph representations by taking the importance of different views into accounts, generating the final drug representations.

DDIs prediction through traditional clinical trials and experiments is an expensive and time-consuming process.

Current machine learning methods for CPI prediction mainly use one-demensional (1D) compound/protein strings and/or the specific descriptors. However, they often ignore the fact that molecules are essentially modeled by the molecular graph. We observe that in real-world scenarios, the topological structure information of the molecular graph usually provides an overview of how the atoms are connected, and the local chemical context reveals the functionality of the protein sequence in CPI. These two types of information are complementary to each other and they are both significant for modeling compound-protein pairs. Motivated by this, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework named GraphCPI , which captures the structural information of compounds and leverages the chemical context of protein sequences for solving the CPI prediction task. Our framework can integrate any popular graph neural networks for learning compounds, and it combines with a convolutional neural network for embedding sequences. To compare our method with classic and state-of-the-art deep learning methods, we conduct extensive experiments based on several widely-used CPI datasets.

Finally, we present applications of drug repurposing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and outline its future challenges.","tags":[],"title":"Deep learning for drug repurposing: Methods, databases, and applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lin, Xuan","Quan, Zhe","Wang, Zhi-Jie","Ma, Tengfei","Xiangxiang Zeng"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"44a2a8f03b2079702a20376ee970c86f","permalink":"https://jacklingroup.github.io/publication/kgnn/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kgnn/","section":"publication","summary":"Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is a challenging problem in pharmacology and clinical application, and effectively identifying potential DDIs during clinical trials is critical for patients and society. Most of existing computational models with AI techniques often concentrate on integrating multiple data sources and combining popular embedding methods together. Yet, researchers pay less attention to the potential correlations between drug and other entities such as targets and genes. Moreover, recent studies also adopted knowledge graph (KG) for DDI prediction. Yet, this line of methods learn node latent embedding directly, but they are limited in obtaining the rich neighborhood information of each entity in KG. To address the above limitations, we propose an end-to-end framework, called Knowledge Graph Neural Network (KGNN), to resolve the DDI prediction. Our framework can effectively capture drug and its potential neighborhoods by mining their associated relations in KG. To extract both high-order structures andsemantic relations of the KG, we learn from the neighborhoods for each entity in KG as their local receptive, and then integrate neighborhood information with bias from representation of the current entity. This way, the receptive field can be naturally extended to multiple hops away to model highorder topological information and to obtain drugs potential long-distance correlations. We haveimplemented our method and conducted experiments based on several widely-used datasets. Empirical results show that KGNN outperforms the classic and state-of-the-art models.","tags":[],"title":"KGNN: Knowledge Graph Neural Network for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction","type":"publication"}]
